# Recognize-The-Fashion-MNIST-Digits
- ###In this project we will implement a LeNet-5 network to recognize the Fashion-MNIST digits:
    - We will modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance you can achieve.
    - Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
    - We will try to use other three CNN models (using transfer learning) and compare the results with the full trained LeNet-5.
